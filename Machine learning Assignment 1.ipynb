    "Answer:\n",

    "    \n",
    "        1. Elbow method: In this method clustering is done using various k values and corresponding WCSS is calculated. Then the WCSS is plotted as a function of k. Clearly for low k values WCSS is high and the WCSS is a monotonically decreasing function of k. But as it is seen after a critical value of k the decrease in WCSS starts behaving asymptotically and an elbow like structure is seen at that critical value of k. This value of k is then used in the final clustering.\n",
    "        2. Silhouette method: Here a perticular metric called Silhouette score(s) is measured for each k. Silhouette score is a measurement of comparison between mean same-cluster distance for a data point and mean distance for nearest neighbouring cluster. The score can vary between -1 to +1. The metric is designed in such a way that a high mean for Silhouette score for entire data set and non-negative Silhouette score for individual data points denote a good cluster quality."

    "\n",
    "Answer: Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning technique where no target variable is present to predict but we are to find any pattern or substructure within the data. There are mainly two types of analyses, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. K means(Partioning) Clustering: In this algorithm the number of cluster is given by hand and hence have a room for ambiguity.\n",
    "    2. Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "        2_a. Agglomerative Clustering: Here all points are considered as individual clusters to begin with and then clubbed together according to their relative distance with each other.\n",
    "        2_b. Divisive Clustering: This algorith assumes all the data in the dataset to be in a single cluster then using dissimilarity index the cluster is broken repetatively.\n",

    "     In both the heirarchical clustering dendrographs are used to draw determine how many clusters should be considered.\n",
    "    3. DBSCAN (Density Based) Clustering: Here a hypersphere of dimension equal to the number of features and radius of a given smalllness parameter is scanned over the entire data set to find a given number of data point within the hypersphere and include them in a cluster. This resolves many limitaions of the clustering methods mentioned above.  \n",
